# Hephaestus - AI-Powered Idea Generation & Development System

Named after the Greek god of craftsmanship and invention, this tool is designed to be your creative companion.

## What Makes It Special

Hephaestus is like having a team of specialized experts at your fingertips. Whether you're:
- Brainstorming a new business venture
- Designing a software architecture
- Planning a scientific experiment
- Exploring new technologies

The system automatically detects your domain and connects you with either a specialized agent or a collaborative team of AI experts to help develop your idea.

## Core Components

### The Brain Trust (Agents)
- **Business Agent**: Your startup advisor and market strategist
- **Code Agent**: Your software architect and technical lead
- **Science Agent**: Your research partner and methodology expert 
- **Technology Agent**: Your innovation guide and tech consultant

Each agent has deep domain knowledge and can:
- Analyze ideas in-depth
- Generate implementation steps
- Create visual diagrams
- Engage in meaningful dialogue
- Provide domain-specific insights

### Collaborative Intelligence

Agents can work together through:
- **Dynamic Composition**: Combine multiple domain experts for complex problems
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Get balanced insights through expert voting
- **Cross-Domain Analysis**: Leverage expertise from multiple fields simultaneously

For example:
- Combine Business + Technology agents for startup tech evaluation
- Mix Science + Code agents for research software development
- Blend Technology + Business + Code for full-stack product development

### Smart Features

1. **Adaptive UI**

The interface morphs based on your domain - cyberpunk for tech, professional for business, etc.

2. **Visual Thinking**

Automatically generates diagrams and visualizations to help you understand complex relationships.

3. **Intelligent Chat**

Have natural conversations with domain experts while maintaining context.

4. **Idea Evolution**

Tracks how your ideas develop and grow over time.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Share your initial concept
2. **Domain Selection**: 
   - Choose your primary domain
   - Select supporting domains for collaborative analysis
3. **Analysis**: 
   - Single domain: Routes to specialized expert
   - Multiple domains: Activates collaborative processing
4. **Development**: 
   - Generates consensus-based suggestions
   - Asks probing questions from multiple perspectives
   - Maps implementation steps
   - Creates visual aids
5. **Iteration**: Engage in dialogue to refine and improve
