# Hephaestus - AI-Powered Idea Generation & Development System

Named after the Greek god of craftsmanship and invention, this tool is designed to be your creative companion.

## What Makes It Special

Hephaestus is like having a team of specialized AI agents at your fingertips. Whether you're:
- Building software solutions (Code Agent)
- Developing business strategies (Business Agent) 
- Conducting scientific research (Science Agent)
- Exploring new technologies (Technology Agent)

The system features:
- Domain-specific agents with specialized knowledge and capabilities
- Multi-agent collaboration for cross-domain insights
- Real-time diagram generation and visualization
- Persistent chat history and data management
- Customizable themes per domain

Key Components:
- Specialized Agents: Each agent (Business, Code, Science, Technology) has domain-specific analysis, implementation, and visualization capabilities
- Base Agent Framework: Shared foundation for all agents with common interfaces
- Layer System: Multi-layer UI architecture for progressive idea development
- Data Management: SQLite-based persistent storage for chat history and diagrams
- Visualization: Automated generation of implementation diagrams and concept visualizations

## Core Components

### The Brain Trust (Agents)
- **Business Agent**: Your startup advisor and market strategist
- **Code Agent**: Your software architect and technical lead
- **Science Agent**: Your research partner and methodology expert 
- **Technology Agent**: Your innovation guide and tech consultant

Each agent has deep domain knowledge and can:
- Analyze ideas in-depth
- Generate implementation steps
- Create visual diagrams
- Engage in meaningful dialogue
- Provide domain-specific insights

### Collaborative Intelligence

Agents can work together through:
- **Dynamic Composition**: Combine multiple domain experts for complex problems
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Get balanced insights through expert voting
- **Cross-Domain Analysis**: Leverage expertise from multiple fields simultaneously

For example:
- Combine Business + Technology agents for startup tech evaluation
- Mix Science + Code agents for research software development
- Blend Technology + Business + Code for full-stack product development

### Smart Features

1. **Visual Thinking**

Automatically generates diagrams and visualizations to help you understand complex relationships.

2. **Intelligent Chat**

Have natural conversations with domain experts while maintaining context.

3. **Idea Evolution**

Tracks how your ideas develop and grow over time.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Share your initial concept
2. **Domain Selection**: 
   - Choose your primary domain
   - Select supporting domains for collaborative analysis
3. **Analysis**: 
   - Single domain: Routes to specialized expert
   - Multiple domains: Activates collaborative processing
4. **Development**: 
   - Generates consensus-based suggestions
   - Asks probing questions from multiple perspectives
   - Maps implementation steps
   - Creates visual aids
5. **Iteration**: Engage in dialogue to refine and improve

## Technical Highlights

- Stable Diffusion for image generation
- SQLite for persistent storage
- Advanced agent collaboration system
- Dynamic consensus mechanisms

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up your OpenAI API key
4. Run:
```bash
python main.py
```

## The Magic Behind It

The real power comes from how it combines:
- Domain expertise
- Collaborative intelligence
- Visual thinking
- Natural dialogue
- Persistent learning
- Adaptive interfaces

Think of it as your personal innovation lab, powered by a team of AI experts working together to help develop any idea you can imagine!

## Using Collaborative Agents

To leverage multiple domains:
1. Enter your concept
2. Select your primary domain
3. Check additional supporting domains
4. Get comprehensive analysis from multiple experts

The system will automatically coordinate between agents to provide:
- Consensus-based recommendations
- Cross-domain insights
- Integrated implementation plans
